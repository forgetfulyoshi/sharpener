Sharpener
=========

Author: Ben Anglin

This is a simple program for generating an intensity-only version of a given
image. The original purpose of the script was to fulfill a homework assignment
and at the moment I don't have time to write up unit tests. Therefore, use this
at your own risk. I will probably add to this as time goes on, but in the
meantime please feel free to use, fork, or even request a pull if you think
you've got something cool. Thanks for checking this out. Usage details are
below.
